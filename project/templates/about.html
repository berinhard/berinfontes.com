      <p>My name's Bernardo Fontes, a.k.a. Berin, and I live of writing and creating code.</p>
      <p>I've been working with Python for several years now, developing web applications, creating services and processing some data.</p>
      <p>I'm the creator of <a href="https://berinhard.github.io/pyp5js/" target="_blank">pyp5js</a>, a tool to translate Python code to p5.js. I'm also the maintainer of <a href="https://model-mommy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html" target="_blank">model_mommy</a>, a Python lib to help writing tests for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> applications.</p>
      <p>Besides that, I use code to give life to a part of my creative ideas.</p>
      <p>I do like a bunch of other things such as reading/writing poetry, listening/composing music and drawing with maths using <a target="_blank" href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>

      <p>In this website you can find links for everything related to myself and my work. Feel free to explore!</p>
